## How to Set Up the Project  

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.  

### 1. Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed:  
- **Python (version 3.12.3)**  
- **PostgreSQL (for the database)**  
- **Git (to clone the repository)**  

### 2. Clone the Repository  
First, download the project to your local machine.  
1. Open your terminal (or command prompt).  
2. Run this command:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/dilshod1405/prohub.uz-authentication.git
   cd prohub.uz-authentication
   ```  

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment  
A virtual environment keeps your project’s dependencies isolated.  
1. Run this command:  
   ```bash  
   python3 -m venv venv  
   ```  
2. Activate the virtual environment:  
   - On Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`  
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  

### 4. Install Dependencies  
The project uses Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 5. Configure Environment Variables  
This project uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information.  
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project folder.  
2. Add the following lines to it, replacing placeholders with your information:  
   ```env  
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  
   DEBUG=True  
   DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name  
   DATABASE_USER=your_database_user  
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password  
   DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1  
   DATABASE_PORT=5432  
   EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend  
   EMAIL_HOST=your_smtp_server  
   EMAIL_PORT=your_smtp_port  
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True  
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com  
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password  
   ```  

### 6. Set Up the Database  
This project uses PostgreSQL.  
1. Open your PostgreSQL client or GUI tool and create a database.  
2. Use the database credentials you added to the `.env` file.  

Apply the database migrations by running:  
```bash  
python3 manage.py migrate  
```  

### 7. Start the Server  
Finally, start the development server by running:  
```bash  
python3 manage.py runserver  
```  
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
